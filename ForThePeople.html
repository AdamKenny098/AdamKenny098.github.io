                    <h4> Narrative Synopsis: </h4>
                    <p>
                        For the People begins in the Sol system with the player assuming the role of Admiral Kril, the commander of the HMX ECLIPSE. After navigating through vast expanses of space for countless solar cycles, the Eclipse has come into orbit around a small, blue planet known as Erith (Earth). Classified as an ancient HellWorld in the nav log, Erith's mysterious and widely unknown history sparks conflict in the mind of Admiral Kril. After much consideration, Admiral Kril dispatches an away team to investigate the planet. The player can choose to either lead the team themselves as Admiral Kril or entrust their second-in-command, Lieutenant Kael, to lead the expedition.
                        Regardless of the choice, the majority of outcomes converge with Admiral Kril assuming direct command of the away team, tasked with exploring Erith's hot, humid, and treacherous jungle terrain. The planet's surface, cloaked in dense foliage and ancient ruins, hides unknown dangers. The away team encounters various hostile elements, including mutated wildlife and treacherous ruins left by a long-extinct civilization. As they delve deeper, the team discovers remnants of advanced yet malevolent technology, hinting at Erith's violent past.
                        After much exploration and overcoming initial threats, Admiral Kril orders the construction of a temporary base on Erith's surface. The camp serves as a headquarters for further missions and a place to regroup and rest. Here, the crew assess their losses, catalog the spoils of their dangerous first contact, and plan their next moves. As night falls, a sense of uneasy calm settles over the crew.
                        Under the cover of darkness, the camp is ambushed by horrifying, radioactively enhanced humans. These mutated beings, descendants of Erith's ancient populus, display a vicious, primal intelligence. In the chaos, many crew members are killed, critically wounded, or taken captive. Admiral Kril and Lt. Kael are among the captured, waking up in a barbaric ruin surrounded by the savage mutants. The ruins are a nightmarish place, where the mutants' cruelty is on full display, as they brutally torture and consume captured crew members.
                        Determined to survive, Admiral Kril and Lt. Kael, along with one or two other surviving crew members (depending on past choices), plot a daring escape from the fortress. Utilizing their wits and any resources they can scavenge, they navigate the treacherous stronghold. Their journey back to the camp or deeper into the jungle is fraught with danger, as the mutants relentlessly hunt them. Along the way, they uncover more about Erith's dark history and the true nature of the mutants.
                        The officers' primary goal is to reestablish contact with the HMX ECLIPSE. This involves finding and repairing ancient communication devices or creating a makeshift beacon from salvaged technology. Each decision made during their escape influences the story's outcome. Will they successfully signal the Eclipse and orchestrate a rescue? Will they succumb to the planet's dangers, or will the mutants find a way to infiltrate the vessel, threatening the entire crew?
                        The player's choices throughout the narrative determine the fate of Admiral Kril, Lt. Kael, and the entire crew of the HMX ECLIPSE. Multiple endings explore themes of survival, sacrifice, and the unforeseen consequences of venturing into the unknown. Whether they escape Erith's grasp or fall victim to its horrors, the echoes of their journey will resonate through the annals of space exploration.

                    <h5> Admiral Kril</h5>
                    <p> 
                        <b>Real Name:</b> Zethanax Kril
                        <b>Alias:</b> Admiral Kril, Zeth
                        <b>Occupation:</b> Admiral of The HMX Eclipse
                        <b>Affiliation:</b> Klorax Empire
                        <b>Base of Operations:</b> HMX Eclipse
                        <b>Height:</b> 4'6" (137 cm)
                        <b>Age:</b> 1.2 hzgtz (equivalent of 354 earth years)
                        <br>
                        <b>Appearance:</b>
                        Admiral Kril is a tall commanding figure, often seen in his red and black carbon fiber uniform. <br>
                        He forgoes the standard issue helmet for a more favorable open headed approach, showing off his gray reptilian like skin. <br>
                        His most striking detail is his scarred eye, having lost it in a combat mission earning him his promotion and Urgavar’s blessing. <br>
                        Equipped with an optical visor Admiral Kril analyzes and takes charge of battlefields before his opponents have the chance to fire. <br>
                        His entire demeanor is designed to evoke a sense of authority and power, reflecting his status in the empire.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Background:</b><br>
                        Hailing from the poor colony worlds of the outer reaches of the Klorax empire, Zethanax Kril was an unlikely candidate for his current position. Once a lowly trooper, Kril quickly climbed the ranks, showing outstanding judgment in battle, having served on some of the greatest vessels in the known sector whilst partaking in countless gruesome inter-planetary wars. 
                        Once appointed with the rank of Admiral, Kril was given the HMX Eclipse to carry out his most sacred duty. Expanding the empire at all costs. With his astute sense of tactics, leadership and battle nothing will stand in his way. 
                        <br>
                        <b>Personality:</b><br>
                        Admiral Kril can be cold, calculating, and driven by a desire to prove himself, however in the heat of battle, his compassion for his subordinates can be seen with even the lowest casualty reports. On the surface he may seem distant and changed from his earlier cheery self but that is just the tired man, sick of death and war. Ambitious as always his head is forever in the stars, ready to subjugate or establish new worlds for the Klorax Royals.<br>
                        <b>Role in For The People</b><br>
                        Players will step into Admiral Kril’s shoes and control the actions he takes throughout the game. Order his soldiers, embark through the stars, and bring glory to the empire as this once lowly grunt.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Relationships</b><br>
                        Lieutenant Kael: Lieutenant Kael is not only Kril’s right hand officer but also his most trusted friend. Having started out together and fought alongside one another, their countless battles have led to an unbreakable trust in one another. <br>
                        Klorax Royals: Serving the Celestial Sovereigns directly is Admiral Kril’s sole purpose now. As he is not a Klorax his position is ever fragile. What they ask he will deliver, or else.<br>

                    <h5> Lieutenant Kael</h5>
                    <p> 
                        <b>Real Name:</b> Kael Al Varnoss <br>
                        <b>Alias:</b> Lieutenant Kael <br>
                        <b>Occupation:</b> Second in Command of The HMX Eclipse <br>
                        <b>Affiliation:</b> Klorax Empire <br>
                        <b>Base of Operations:</b> HMX Eclipse <br>
                        <b>Height:</b> 4" (122 cm) <br>
                        <b>Age:</b> 0.8 hzgtz (equivalent of 236 earth years) <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Appearance:</b><br>
                        Lieutenant Kael is a presence of authority, most always seen dressed in her battle armor attire, forgoing the helmet as does her Admiral. <br>
                        The periwinkle skin of her amphifluous species stands out amongst the rest of the crew, mainly composed of Klorax drones and workers.  <br>
                        Her suit possesses two large tanks for liquid ammonia to keep her hydrated along with the standard universal translators and gravitational shields. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Background:</b><br>
                        When the Klorax empire invaded she lost less than most, orphaned by predator attacks on her remote village.<br>
                        Once the Klorax eliminated the threat, she was on the first shuttle to boot camp.<br>
                        After being sorted into the same division as the loner Zethanax Kril, the duo soon formed a bond that would be tested and hardened by a long war to come. <br>
                        Having watched her closest friend climb the ranks, she swore to him and herself that one day she’d be right there with him, as his superior.<br>
                        She still strives towards this as her personal goal.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Personality:</b><br>
                        Kael when off duty is a bubbly and free spirit, however that all goes away when she dons her armor.<br>
                        Ruthless and powerful are the best two words to describe her in battle, highly intelligent in assessing combatants. <br>
                        When she closes her eyes she can see the countless souls she has had to end, it troubles her deeply and is the main cause for any disdain in her life. <br>
                        Someday she hopes it will all stop, but a habitat in the remote lagoons of her homeworld seems unfathomable now.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Role in For The People</b><br>
                        Players will have Kael by their side in almost all scenarios. She will be their loyal right hand and partner in crime for whatever happens in their adventures through the cosmos.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Relationships</b><br>
                        Admiral Kril: Her commanding officer and long time ally, she sees him with admiration, respect and as a goal to beat. He is a source of competition and a force to push herself. Some say she is more loyal to him than the Sovereigns.<br>
                        Kael’s Squadron: Generally liked throughout the crew she is an example for all aboard to look up to and aims to keep it that way<br>
